        </h2>

          Calisthenics is more than just bodyweight exercises; itâ€™s a testament
          to mastering control, strength, and balance. With every pull-up,
          push-up, and handstand, I push the boundaries of what my body is
          capable of. It's not just about physical gains, but about developing
          mental toughness and resilience. The journey of calisthenics has
          taught me that true strength comes from consistency, patience, and the
          willingness to challenge myself daily.
